            Web-based chat for radical exchange: ephemeral, anonymous, and synchronous.
        </p>

        <h2>üö™üèÉ Choose a room</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Join the public reception or create a private, ephemeral room. Rooms are anonymous and self-destruct when
            empty ‚Äî share private room URLs only with trusted participants. Create your own <code>/room/${NAME}</code> url or use the
            buttons below:
        </p>
        <div id="starter">

            <input type="button" value="Public Reception" onclick="startLobby();">
            <input type="button" value="New Private Room" onclick="startPrivateRoom();">
        </div>
        <div id="note">
            <section aria-labelledby="rules-heading">
                <h3 id="rules-heading">üìú Rules</h3>

                <p>
                    Conspire is an ephemeral, URL-based chat. Each room is identified by a unique URL ‚Äî anyone with that
                    URL can join.
                    Long random URLs are private rooms, share them only with trusted participants.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ephemeral rooms:</strong> Rooms are created when the first participant joins and are
                        deleted automatically when the last participant leaves. No room data survives after deletion.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Access control:</strong> Possession of the room URL grants access. Treat URLs like keys
                        and avoid posting them publicly.</li>
                    <li><strong>History limits:</strong> Chat history is available to newly joined participants but is
                        limited to 100 previous messages and is removed when the room is deleted. No data is stored
                        permanently on our server.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section aria-labelledby="files-heading">
                <h3 id="files-heading">üíæ File sharing</h3>

                <p>
                    Share one or multiple files directly with other participants. Files are streamed peer-to-peer from
                    the host's browser to recipients ‚Äî the server does not receive, inspect, or store file contents.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The host announces a file, peers request chunks, and data is
                        streamed in small pieces to avoid large memory spikes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Files remain accessible only while the host keeps sharing. If the
                        host cancels sharing or leaves the room, the files become unavailable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser behavior:</strong> Your browser will prompt you to pick files to share and to
                        save incoming files. Sizes and speeds depend on network conditions and peer bandwidth.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Safety tip: only accept files from people you trust and verify file names and sizes before opening
                    downloads.
                </p>
